### How to create your own art by using TurtleGraphicsPainter.
#### Define how to draw.
```dart
void _drawing(TurtleGraphicsPainter painter, Canvas canvas, Size size) {
  // Start at any point.
  painter.moveToPoint(size.center(Offset.zero));
  // Start turning by an angle, or you can use method setAngle.
  painter.turnRight(angle);
  // Use painter to draw somethings. See TurtleGraphicsCollection. 
  painter.drawSpiralByRadius(
    alpha: alpha,
    radius: spiralRadius,
    count: circleCount,
    deltaRadius: deltaSpiralRadius,
    deltaAlpha: deltaAlpha,
    drawDot: (canvas, size) {
      // Draw a point.
      painter.drawPoint(
          canvas, Paint()..color = Colors.white, painter.currentPoint, 1);
    },
    canvas: canvas,
    size: size,
  );
}

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
